- Session in other browser doesn’t terminate after changing password or email address
- Session fixation / expiration / replay attacks (session cookie is valid after sign out)
- Absence of Cross-Site Request Forgery (“CSRF”) token in non-critical processes, this includes Login and Logout CSRF
- Attacks requiring physical access to a user's device
- Vulnerabilities that require a potential victim to install non-standard software or otherwise take active steps to make themselves be susceptible

- Presence of banner or version information unless correlated with a vulnerable version
- UI and UX bugs and spelling mistakes
- Distributed Denial of Service (“DDOS”) or Denial of Service (“DOS”)
- ClickJacking without working proof of concept. Limited to 1 user-interaction only, mostly clicking a button that could affect the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
- Tabnabbing
- Missing Best Practices
- Hypothetical or Theoretical vulnerabilities without actual verification or validation
- Vulnerabilities attributable to out-of-date browsers or platforms
